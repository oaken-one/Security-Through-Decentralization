# Security Through Decentralization

This repository contains all the code that backs the senior-thesis project “Security Through Decentralization: Blockchain’s Role in IoT Networks”. Three alternative firmware-update architectures for a fleet of 10 Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 + MKR ENV Shield sensors were built and benchmarked:

Local Python Server – classic client–server on a LAN

Arduino IoT Cloud – vendor cloud OTA updates

Blockchain-Integrated – private Ethereum PoA ledger + smart-contract-driven updates

The repo also includes Arduino sketches that simulate hacking attacks and update sketches that simulate firmware updates.
